# HelloWorldInternational-Project
Please code a program in Java that asks the user to choose a language. After getting the inputted language the user will need to output the standard "Hello World" program in the language chosen. There must be error checking on the input. Each language must be coded in a separate method. Advanced CS1 students must do 6 languages. AP CSA students must do 10 languages.  Additionally, the program must restart at the end of the Hello World after asking the user if they want to continue. For all students one of the languages must be Pig-Latin. BONUS POINTS: If the user chooses Despacito for the language the Despacito music must start to play and then end after 10 seconds and then say "No seriously, what language?"  STILL MORE BONUS POINTS:  Don Juan challenge - create a webpage to go along with this assignment.

Please submit a Google Doc copy of your code to this assignment when done.

Decided not to do the webpage, but an app instead. Has the pig latin, has the despacito, and has multiple different languages.
